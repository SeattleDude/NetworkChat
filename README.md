# JellyChat

## Anonymous chat program

This pair of client and server programs is designed with the users privacy in mind.
The only data the server has access to about the client is their public IP, and chatlogs. There are no cookies to delete, or pesky tracking to evade.

The connection between the client and server is encrypted using symmetric passphrase based encryption.
